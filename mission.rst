Loving Others: Living a Missional Life
=============================================

Introduction
------------

**How do we live missionally?**

When we experience life transformation through Jesus Christ and bring this transformation to everything we do, we are living missionally.  This means sharing the good news of Christ with others and making disciples of all nations.  It also means living God's love and grace and having godly priorities whatever our life calling. Who we are and what we say are both important as we work to build God's kingdom.

Theme Scriptures
----------------

**Matthew 4:19** *Come follow me and I will make you fishers of men.*

**Mark 3:14**  *He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach.*

In the Word
-----------

1. Read Matthew 4:19 and Mark 3:14

2. We should remember that the Jesus’ first priority is that we be with him.
	* Why do you that Jesus wanted his disciples to be with him in relation to preaching the gospel?
	* Based on this where do you think you are in terms of living these verses?

		1. Still havent started following Jesus

		2. Need to be with Jesus more consistently

		3. Starting to be sent to reach others with the message.

		4. God often uses you to share Jesus with others.

	.. topic:: * Leader's Note*

		We don’t stop sharing the gospel just because we’ve missed a quiet time. However, it should always be our top priority to live from the overflow of God and not in our own strength.

3. The second priority Jesus gave was that we should preach the gospel.
	* What does preaching the gospel mean to you?

3. Why do you think Jesus gave these two priorities?

4. Mathew 28:16-20 is called the Great Comission (CO-mission)

	**Matthew 28:16-20**

		*Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said,“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."*

	1. What is the mission?

	2. What or why the Co-?

		.. topic:: * Leader's Note*

			God's mission is making disciples who will live for him in every area of life. The co- talks about the partnership with Jesus who 'will be with us always'. Some commentaries say that this phrase “Therefore go” is translated from Greek “as you go” meaning as you are doing your daily life make disciples. When we live this way it is called living a missional life.

	3,  Is making disciples part of your daily life?



	4. Discuss the difference in meaning between missions and missional.

	.. topic:: * Leader's Note*

		“This is what it means to be missional. We experience the transforming truth of Christ and bring it to everything we do. Sometimes this means we work to share the specific truth of Christ’s grace. This is the traditional approach to missions. But often we share the common truth of grace, helping others to understand how their work contributes to the common good.

		“Witness is not just a little activity we do now and again. Witness is who we are,” said Guder. “The world will encounter God’s love in Christ… because Christians are equipped by God’s Spirit using Scripture to demonstrate the truth, the relevance, the healing power of the gospel.”  http://www.thehighcalling.org

	5. Be intentional.

		* Share the gospel in your daily life through as you meet people and become their friend.

		* Pray and look for opportunities to help those you meet, pray for them, or share with them scriptural truth.

		* Have the attitude of Christ in everything you do.  A quote sometimes attributed to St. Francis of Assisi is "Preach the gospel always, and if necessary, use words."

		* Extend invitations to small group, life group, church or other places where people will hear the gospel.

		* Share testimonies of what Christ has done in your life with family and friends.



	6. What to share

		* What Jesus has done for you (your testimony in 3 min. or less)
		* Who Jesus is.
		* What He has done.
		* Why He did it ?
		* How do we respond?

	7. Pray together for friends who do not know Jesus.  Ask God to highlight someone and give you opportunities to share with them this week. Pray with each other for boldness and open hearts.

Live the Word
-------------

	1.   Look over the list of creative ways to be missional and pick one to do this week alone or with someone in your small group

	2.   Study  one of the Models for sharing the gospel this week and share it with your small group next week.
		* Romans Road
		* Bridge Diagram
		* The Four Spiritual Laws

	3.  Go out of your way to do something to serve someone who is not a Christian this week.

	.. topic:: *But I’m not a Christian ...*	

		* You might not have come to believe 100% that Jesus is the way to God but you can still share with others your thoughts about God or thoughts about what you have learned about the Bible.
		* You can still live with others in mind. Do something nice for someone this week that you normally wouldn’t do.
 		* Take time this week to study what is "the good news" that the Christians are teaching about Jesus. Here are some verses that you can look at Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8, Romans 10:9-10, Romans 10:13,  Romans 5:1, Romans 8:1, Romans 8:38-39.
