==================================
Loving God: Spending Time with God
==================================

Introduction
------------

**Develop your relationship with God**

In order to get to know someone it is necessary to spend time with that person.  If you want to know God it is no different.  Spending time alone with God connects you to his Spirit and allows you to know the God of the universe in a personal way.    This communion is the basis for your existence as a believer in Christ.  This lesson will encourage you and equip you to set aside time to be in relationship with your Heavenly Father.
