Loving God: Understanding His Plan
====================================

Introduction
------------

**Covenant Relationship -- God's Metanarrative**

The Bible was written over a period of 1500 years by 40 different authors in 66 books.  However, throughout the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation we can read one story of God demonstrating His love for people and calling them to be set apart in a loving relationship with Him.  God chose to share His love with us first and then asks us to  commit in love towards him in a covenant relationship. The truths shared in this lesson about understanding the big picture of the Bible and what it tells us about God and His loving plan for humankind will be enlightening for pre-believers, new believers and Christians at all stages of their Christian walk.

Theme Scriptures
----------------

**Acts 17:24-31**
	*The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things; and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are His children'. Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man. Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.*

**Jeremiah 31:31-33**
	*"Behold, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them," declares the Lord. "But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days," declares the Lord, "I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."*

		.. topic:: *Leader Note*

D.  **Look at a list of books of the Bible**

	.. only:: leader

	     .. topic:: *Leader Note*

	     	Show that Bible structured in 2 main parts called Old and New (Testament = Covenant). Find out how familiar your group is with structure and books of the Bible. For further information you may refer them to the Bible timeline, offer to meet with them one by one to go over the Big picture or refer them to a Discover the Bible/Discover Jesus class if one is currently meeting.

E. **Read Jeremiah 31:31-33**

	#. Based on this verse what kind of relationship does God want to have with his people?

		`__________________________________________________________________________`
		`__________________________________________________________________________`
	#. Discuss Jeremiah's reference to covenant(s) and the comparison to marriage. What might a prospective fiance's proposal look like with only one of the two components of covenant?

F. **Three components of understanding God's plan**

	.. only:: leader

		.. topic:: *Leader Note*

			Go over the points below and then read through the options in the Live the Word section below with your group. Have each person in your small group choose one of the ideas (or create their own) and share with the group which they will try to do this week.

	*Metanarrative= Big picture, the overarching storyline*

	1.  An Intentional Perspective... of God's plan

		Challenge the perspective that the Old and New Testament have no continuity.
		
		Ask God to give you His perspective on His plan revealed in the Bible. Since He desires for you to see truth with clarity... ask Him!
 
	2.  An Intentional Pursuit ... of God's plan
		
		Pursue Scripture where the big picture is visibly summarized in condensed passages... like Luke 22 and 24; Acts 10 and 17 
 
	3. An Intentional Plan ... for understanding God's plan (Choose one of the ideas from the Live the Word section to try this week.)

	
.. topic:: *But I'm not a Christian...*

	.. only:: leader

		**Use these notes for non-Christians or true beginners instead of the study above**
		
		*1. What kind of Book is the Bible?* 

			* (letter, love story?, list of rules?) get the group member’s impressions
			* Look at list of books of the Bible. Present the idea of the Bible as a library.  (66 books written by different authors at different times about 1 theme)
			* Explain the idea of the Old Testament (covenant) before Jesus and the New Testament (covenant) after Jesus

		*2. How did we get the Bible?*

			* The idea of inspiration-- God didn't recite the words of the Bible word for word to the authors  but 'inspired' the writers  through the Holy Spirit and had them use their own personalities and languages to write His Message. This is very different from a Mormon or Muslim idea of 'revelation'.
			* 40 Authors over 1500 years
			* Overview of the styles and content of the books of the Bible.

		*3. Read Acts 17: 24-31*

			Identify big picture components that Paul highlighted while in Athens.

			1. God is Creator
				'The God who made the world... all mankind'
				Genesis 1 speaks of man being 'made...'
			2. Mankind is designed to seek relationship
				'… that they (mankind) might seek God'
				Genesis 1 speaks of being 'made in His image' (intellect, will, emotion, etc)
			3. God calls mankind to a reconciled relationship
				Repent = Acknowledge broken relationship and Turn away from 'sin' and to God
				Genesis 3 Demonstrates that God initiates reconciliation: 'Where are you?'
				Genesis 12 God sets in motion a reconciliation plan thru Abram's seed / Israel
			4. God appoints a Righteous Judge 
				(Messiah = Christ is a Greek equivalent for this title)
				God promises and predicts Messiah (Prophet, Priest, Judge, King)
				God reconciles man's relationship through Him (Jesus) before judgement
				God has raised Him (Jesus) from the dead as affirmation of His unique role

Live the Word
-------------

A. Practice overviewing the Scriptures through scanning and reviewing. Give yourself 30 min to scan an entire book of Bible... ie. Gen., Ex., Lk.

		* Divide 30 minutes by the number of chapters...  ie. Genesis has 50 chapters, so give yourself a little over 30 seconds per chapter
			
		* Be disciplined to move forward and avoid getting lost in details
			
		* Ask the Lord to reveal 2-3 significant observations during the 30 minute exercise
			
		* Record your observations
 
B. Practice overview of Scriptures through listening to an audio Bible

		* Example: Listen to an audio version of Mark with the intent of getting the 'Big Picture', 76 minutes total... To get an overview of Mark in just 8 days, listen once a day for 2 chapters or about 10 minutes.
			
		* Use the last 5 minutes of the 15 minute exercise each day  to reflect on the Big picture content and record your observations on that day's scriptures.
 
C. Practice exposure to Scriptures through listening to an audio Bible
			
		* Got a 12 minute bus ride? You can listen to a part of the Bible you've never read... like (Ruth, Haggai, Malachi, Colossians, Philemon, 1John, Jude...)
			
		* Got a 3 hour road trip? You can listen to Genesis in a little over 180 minutes!
			
		* Ambitious with a bit under 16 hrs this week? Try this: be exposed in one week to the entire New Testament by audio for just 2hrs 15min/day... 953 minutes total)

D. Discover how books in the Bible are organized or memorize the books of the Bible (see the chart in the resources section for more information)
			
		1.  Old Testament

			* Law (Genesis-Deuteronomy)
			* History (Joshua-Esther)
			* Wisdom and Poetry (Job-Song of Solomon)
			* Prophets (Isaiah-Malachi)
			
		2. New Testament
		
			* Gospels and Acts (Matthew-Acts) 
			* Paul's letters (Romans-Philmon)
			* Other letters (Hebrews-Jude)
			* Prophecy  (Revelation)
 
E. Practice telling God's story using the biblical timeline provided in the resource section

.. topic:: *But I'm not a Christian...*

	* Watch the Hope Project video for an overview of the Bible (see resource section below)
	* Meet one on one with a Christian to spend more time talking about God's plan.
