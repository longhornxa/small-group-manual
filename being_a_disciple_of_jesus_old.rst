Loving God by Being a Disciple of Jesus
=======================================

Introduction
------------

**Love God -- By becoming a Jesus' disciple**

One of the last things that Jesus shared with his disciples was the command to make more disciples. As followers of Christ we too are encouraged to be a disciple and make disciples.  Have you ever wondered how to do that? Have you ever wanted to change or grow in an area of your life or spiritual journey? Jesus' answer for this was discipleship.  This lesson will give you ways in which you can grow in your relationship with Christ with the goal of being transformed into his image.

	     .. topic:: *Leader Note*

          *1. The scripture above quotes Jesus' teaching to His apostles shortly Before He ascended to heaven*

          *2. This scripture is commonly called "The Great Commission."*

          *3. The imperative in this scripture is "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations”, The rest of the passage is followed by description in what things should accompany this initial command. At the very end Jesus intends to comfort his disciples with knowing that he will not leave them.*
  
B. **Definition of a Disciple**
  
  In your opinion what does it mean to be Jesus' disciple? Do you consider yourself a disciple of Jesus?	

    .. only:: leader

      .. topic:: *Leader Note*

          *1. The word "disciple" literally means 'learner'.*

          *2. According to Vine's Expository Dictionary Of New Testament Words, it denotes "one who follows another's teaching"*

          *3. But a disciple was not only a learner, he was also an *Adherant* For this reason disciples were spoken of as *imitators* of their teachers.*

          *4. Is believing in Jesus enough to be a disciple?*

          *5. What about attending church services regularly?*

C. **The Goal of being a Disciple**
	 
	Read Luke 6:40 and Romans 8:29. According to these Scriptures what is the goal of being a disciple?

    .. only:: leader 

      .. topic:: *Leader Note*

          To be Christ's disciple, then, is to strive to be like Him! Do you have a strong desire to follow Jesus and become like Him? Unless you do, it cannot be said that you are truly His disciple!
 
D. **The Marks of a Disciple**

	  .. only:: leader 

      .. topic:: *Leader Note*

  		  	Have each small group member look up one of these scriptures and share with the group what it says about the marks of a disciple. 

  	1. John 8:31   '_________________________________________________________________'
   	2. Matthew 7:21-27   '_________________________________________________________________'
  	3. John 13:34-35   '_________________________________________________________________'
 	  4. John 15:8   '_________________________________________________________________'

    .. topic:: *Leader Note*

       A.  **A Disciple is one who abides in Jesus' words** - Jn 8:31
      		1. This would imply being a diligent student of the teachings of
         	Christ
      		2. It also requires one to be a "doer" of the Word - Mt 7:21-27;
         	Jn 1:21-25
      		3. In view of this, a true disciple would...
         		* Study the Bible diligently
         		* Seek opportunities to study with others
                (e.g., Bible classes, church services, gospel meetings).
         		* Look for opportunities to act on what is studied
     
       B. **A Disciple shows love to other believers** - Jn 13:34-35
      		1. With a love patterned after the love of Jesus ("as I have
         	loved you")
      		2. With a love that is visible to the world ("by this all will
         	know")
      		3. Therefore, a true disciple would...
         		* Make every effort to get to know his brethren
         		* Take advantage of occasions to encourage and grow closer to
                them (e.g., attending services on Sunday and Wednesday
                nights)
      		4. Remember, a disciple is one who wants to become like his
         	teacher
         		* Was Jesus willing to sacrifice time and effort for His
                brethren?
         		* Of course, and so will we... If we are truly his disciples!
     
       C. **A Disciple will bear much fruit** - Jn 15:8
      		1. Notice the word "much" (also found in verse 5)
         		* Jesus is not talking about an occasional good deed
         		* But a lifestyle which prompts people to glorify God!- Mt 5:16
      		2. This is so important, that failure to bear much fruit has serious consequences - Jn 15:1-2
      		 
        D. The point should be clear:  to be a disciple of Jesus Christ means more that just a casual church member.  It requires COMMITMENT, especially in regards to:
 
          * The teachings of Christ
          * The love of brethren
          * Bearing fruit to the glory of God

        The kind of commitment involved is seen further when we consider the "high cost" of discipleship demanded by Jesus in Lk 14:25-33...]

E. **Reflection**

.. only:: leader

    .. topic:: *Leader Note*

      Have the group members think about and discuss the reflection questions and then read through the options in the Live the Word section below with your group. Have each person in your small group choose one of the ideas (or create their own) and share with the group which they will try to do this week.

    1. Consider the marks of a disciple of Jesus: obeying the teachings of Christ, showing love for other believers and bearing fruit to the glory of God, and give an example of how a disciple might demonstrate these.
 
    2. Do you feel that you have been trying to actively follow Christ's example as His disciple?
    3. What is one step you will take this week to follow Jesus as His disciple?


.. topic:: *But I'm not a Christian...*

    *1. Read the following scriptures*

        *Matthew 4:18-22
        *John 8:31
        *John 13:35
        *Matthew 28:9-20

    *2. Why do you think the disciples followed Jesus?*
    *3. Why would it be important for the disciples to do what Jesus did?*
    *4. What does being a disciple look like?*
    *5. What does being baptized mean to you?*
    *6. If you are interested in beginning to be Jesus' disciple, there are some first steps you can take*

        **The ABC's of Salvation **
 	      A. Admit you are a sinner. Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23
 	      B. Believe that Jesus died and rose again to save you from your sins. Romans 5:8
        C. Confess that Jesus is Lord and that you are going to follow Him and obey him.  I John 1:9

Live the Word
-------------


#.  Read some of the teachings of Jesus from one of the Gospels this week. Meditate on how a 21st century disciple could put these into practice. 
#. One of the marks of a disciple is to "show love to other believers".  Find a way this week to be a blessing to another Christian. 
#. Decide on your own way to follow Jesus more in discipleship this week and have an accountability partner ask you about it sometime during the week.
