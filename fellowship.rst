Loving Others: Fellowship
================================

Introduction
------------

**Fun and Friendship are Important to our Spiritual Life**

Fellowship is much more than just getting together, talking and eating although these things are perhaps some of the outward expressions of fellowship. True fellowship is how we live out Jesus command to "Love one another as I have loved you" (John 13:34) Our attitude towards other Christians and how we treat each other can also reflect our love for God. What our fellowship shows about our relationships is also usually what attracts or repels others about our community.

Theme Scriptures
----------------

**John 13:34-35**
	*“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”*

**1 John 4:19-21**
	*"We love because he first loved us. Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister."*

**Hebrews 10:24-25**
	*"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching."*

Live the Word

1. Do your own Bible study on fellowship by looking at at least 10 of the 'one another' verses in the New Testament.  Use Biblegateway.com or a concordance to find verses that mention what we should do with and to "one another".  Use these verses to make a list of all the different things that God would like to see in our community.
2. Plan a time for your small group to hang out and fellowship with each other sometime in the next couple of weeks. 
3. Invite someone in one of your spiritual communities (church, Chi Alpha, small group) to your home for dinner one day this week or on the weekend. 
4. Choose one of the examples that was given during the discussion of John 13:35 and intentionally do it this week to show love to someone in your community. 

.. topic:: *But I'm not a Christian* 

   *1. Have you noticed anything that is different about Christian groups you have visited?*
   
   *2. If you do not regularly go to church or to Life group, try it this week as an opportunity to learn more about what it means to be part of a Christian group.*

   *3. Invite a Christian friend to do something fun with you this week.*
