Purpose of History Sharing
--------------------------

The goal of history sharing is to build intimacy and a basic familiarity with the spiritual journeys of each person in the group that will help you as a leader to get a sense for where they are spiritually. 

History Sharing Semester Schedule
---------------------------------

Week 1 or 2:  The leader should set the example by being the one to start the history sharing in the first couple of weeks.  
Weeks 2-4 (or however many people you have in the group).   Each week one group member should share their story for about 15 minutes.  
Weeks 5-12  There is a suggested History Sharing question in each lesson that will help you to get to know each other in the group better.  Or you can make your own questions (or have group members take turns asking the question each week.)  Divide the 15 minutes by the number of people in your group and ask people to stick to the time limit when sharing their answer. You can also use the time for sharing updates on how specific things are going in each othersâ€™ lives once group members are comfortable sharing with each other without prompts. However, you still may need to set a time limit especially if one person tends to dominate the sharing time.  

Suggested Components of History Sharing
