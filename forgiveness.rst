Forgiveness
===========
 
**Sometimes forgiveness is a hard subject to discuss because of the deep emotions that come with it. We all know what it is like to be hurt by someone, some of us so bad that it has changed us and we haven’t been the same since that hurt was administered to us. Yet as Christians Christ calls us to live above that hurt and to walk in forgiveness to those who have done us wrong. As we meditate on the great forgiveness of God to us we are reminded of Jesus’ words in Luke 6:36 “Forgive and you will be forgiven.”**

	2. Talk to God this week ask Him to forgive anything that comes to your mind or bad things that you know that you have done.
	3. Do you agree with Romans 10:9? Why or why not? IF you agree would you be willing to pray and follow what the verse says?
	
	Becoming a christian simply means acknowledging that you are living far away from God and that you need his help to live a life of true purity and goodness. The Bible says in Romans 10:9 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
