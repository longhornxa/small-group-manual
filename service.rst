Loving God by Serving Others
============================

Introductions
-------------

**focus on loving others** 

Just as we have discussed how God created us for relationship with Him, He has also equally created us to relate to others in a loving way. In the New Testament one of the key ways of receiving deep communion and intimacy with others is called fellowship.  This was done primary with other believers in their local church or what we now sometimes call spiritual community.  This lesson will provide us with deeper insight into how to how to live in and add enrichment to our own spiritual communities.**
