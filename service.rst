Loving God: Serving Others
============================

Introduction
-------------

**Service -- Our place in the body of Christ**

God make you unique and gave you specific gifts and abilities so that you could fulfil his purpose. One of the things God calls us to to is to serve others.  Howe we serve might differ from one person to another, but we are all called to serve. Serving could mean helping people who need help, serving in our spiritual community to help fulfil the great commission or seeing something that needs to be done in our city, state or world and doing it for God's glory.
