Loving God: Walking in Obedience
=======================================

**If we love God we will follow His commands. **

Obedience is perhaps the most important way that we can show our love for God.  In fact, Jesus states that if we love Him we will keep his commmandments.  If we say that we love God but we are not willing to obey God, then we are hypocrites in our faith. Obedience includes being willing to do what God asks us to do and being willing to stop doing what God tells us not to do. It's source should be a heart full of love for God, but it must go beyond the heart and become evident in our choices and actions.

		* Paul says we are like the different kinds of dishes and pots in a large house: "Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work." (2 Tim. 2:20-21)

		* Paul wants us to ask ourselves, which kind of vessel do I want to be in God's kingdom? If, as a Christian, I fill my mind and heart with "dishonorable" things before God, I can expect to be like a vessel for "dishonorable use" (like the scrub bucket or the garbage can or the dish we put the dog food in).

		* God may still use me for something in his kingdom, but there won't be much blessing in it. But, if I turn away from things that dishonor God, if I keep from my eyes and my mind from "what is dishonorable," then I will be to God like a dish made of gold or silver, "a vessel for honorable use ... ready for every good work." If we want God to use us in significant ways, we have to walk in obedience to him. 
 

D.	Our obedience can help others who are not Christians come to Christ
	
	1.	Read - 1 Peter 2:12. According to this verse, what is another result of living an obedient life?

	2.	How can our actions be a witness to unbelievers?
	
	3.	Does the way that you treat others push them closer or further from God?
	
	4.	What are ways that you can live that would help others to draw closer to God?

	We should obey God because we desire to see unbelievers come to Christ through observing our lives. Peter tells believers that their good conduct will be their defense against slander and will often lead to the conversion of those who first speak against them.
 
E.	Reflection: Think about your life, and answer these questions
 
	1. Is there any specific area of your life in which you are not fully loving God because of your disobedience to Him?
	
	2. What are things you can do to surrender those areas of disobedience to God and dedicate yourself to Him more fully?  
	
	3. Have you followed the Lord in obedience in water baptism? See Mathew 28:19-20.
  
Live the Word

.. topic:: *But I'm not a Christian...*
	
	A. Read John 14:21
 	
	B. Discuss these questions

		* *As you are learning about God, do you feel like He loves you and desires good for your life?*

		* *Why does God put so much emphasis on following his commands?*
		* *Do you have a desire to please God in your own life?*
		* *Do you think that there are any benefits for living a life like Jesus?*
