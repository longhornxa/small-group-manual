====================================
Loving God: Understanding His Word
====================================

Introduction
------------

**A library**

The Bible was written over a period of 1500 years by 40 different authors in 66 books.  However, throughout the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation we can read one story of God demonstrating His love for people and calling them to be set apart in a loving relationship with Him.  God chose to share His love with us first and then asks us to commit in love towards him in a covenant relationship. The truths shared in this lesson about understanding the big picture of the Bible and what it tells us about God and His loving plan for humankind will be enlightening for pre-believers, new believers and Christians at all stages of their Christian walk.

Theme Scriptures
----------------

**2 Timothy 3:16-17**
    *All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

**Hebrews 4:12**
    *For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.*

**Mathew 4:4**
    *Jesus answered, "It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"*

 
In the Word
-----------

1. Read 2 Timothy 3:16-17. Why should we read the Bible?

    ``__________________________________________________________________________``

2. Historically we know that the Bible was written over 1500 years by 40 difference authors. In that context, what do you think 'All Scripture is God-breathed' means? 

                * The idea of inspiration-- God didn't recite the words of the Bible word for word to the authors  but 'inspired' the writers  through the Holy Spirit and had them use their own personalities and languages to write His Message. This is very different from a Mormon or Muslim idea of 'revelation'.

3. Open to the contents page of your Bible. How is it structured?

            * (letter, love story?, list of rules?) get the group member’s impressions
            * Look at list of books of the Bible. Present the idea of the Bible as a library.  (66 books written by different authors at different times about 1 theme)
            * Explain the idea of the Old Testament (covenant) before Jesus and the New Testament (covenant) after Jesus
            * 40 Authors over 1500 years
            * Overview of the styles and content of the books of the Bible.
