Loving God through Worship
==========================

**Worship -- Expressions of Love**

The way we express our love towards God is called worship.  There are many ways to worship God. In this lesson you will discuss both new and familiar ways to show God how much you love him. As in a human love relationship, in our relationship with God if the love is never expressed, the relationship will not grow. The more you know who God is the more you can express your love for Him in worship. This cycle continues much like a well formed dance. It is our prayer that this lesson will lead you into deeper expression of God's love for you and your love for Him.

Theme Scriptures
----------------
 
**Exodus 20:3-5**  *You must not have any other god but me. You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods.* 
 
**Psalms 95:6**  *Come, let us worship  and bow down. Let us kneel before the LORD our maker.*
 
**Romans 12:1**  *And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice, the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him.*

            .. topic:: *Leader Note*

                For each point, share your own experience and ask the group to share personal examples of when they did this or saw this done by someone else that they know.  Also discuss how each act was an act of worship.

    There are many expressions of worship. When we do these things with an attitude of reverence and a motivation of love towards God we are engaging in worship.

    * Obedience
    * Service
    * Praise (lifting up of hands, shouting, dancing etc)
    * Forgiveness
    * Love
    * Exercising Spiritual Gifts
    * Art
    * Songs
    * Daily living (Working at your job, Cleaning your house, etc)
    * Going to church
    * Worshipping with other believers

D. **Discuss** 

	1. What happens when there is no worship of the true God in a place, nation, etc? (missions exists because worship doesn't)
	2. What is one way this week that you can bring worship into your life? 
	3. What is one way you can invite others to join you in worship?  Or how can you bring worship into your area of influence?

E. **Take one or two of the ways to worship God and practice them together.**

Live the Word
-------------
1. During a worship service (aka life group, church, community gathering, etc)  try one new expression of worship. (For example if you have never raised your hands, raise them in praise, or you have never knelt down bow before the Lord, then kneel in worship).   
2.  This week follow through with one act of obedience as worship to God. (for example if God is asking you spend a longer prayer time do it, if God has asked you to call some one, do)
3.  Choose one of the ways to worship God mentioned in this lesson or the resources and try to focus on worshipping God for at least 15 minutes each day this week.  You can do the same type of worship every day or try a different one each day. 
 

.. topic:: *But I'm not a Christian*
