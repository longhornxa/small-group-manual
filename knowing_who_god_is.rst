Introduction

**Who is the God of the Bible?**


How you think about God will form the foundation of your relationship with Him and your interactions with him.  But what if you are wrong in your thinking about God?  Good thing we have the Bible as a guide to help us discover the answer to who God really is.  This lesson will also help you learn more about who God is for you and to you in order to lay a foundation for your interactions with the *Great I AM*.

Theme Scriptures

**Isaiah 24:5**
	*I am the Lord, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God.*

**Psalms 147:5**
	*Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.*

**Exodus 34:5-7**
	*Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the Lord. And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”*

In the Word

#. **Find Isaiah 40 in your Bible** 

	This is really the hinge chapter for the entire book of Isaiah. The first 39 chapters described the dark judgment of God. But now, the prophet tells of the promises of restoration, the coming of the Messiah and the future blessings in store for the nation of Israel. And it all begins in chapter 40 with a description of the greatness of our God.

	In verses 9-31, the prophet Isaiah is painting an accurate picture of the nature and character of God to the nation of Israel. Like us, they had quickly forgotten what God was really like. He says in verse 9, 'Here is your God!'

#. **Read verses 10-11**
	#. How is God described in each verse? 

		`__________________________________________________________________________`
		`__________________________________________________________________________`
	#. How can God can be both a mighty ruler and a tender shepherd at the same time?

		`__________________________________________________________________________`
		`__________________________________________________________________________`

#. **Read verses 12-17** 
	Isaiah asks as series of questions beginning with “who” or “with whom.” 

	* What insights do you learn about God's character from these verses?

		`__________________________________________________________________________`
		`__________________________________________________________________________`

#. **Read verses 18-26** 
	Israel was tempted to forsake the living and true God for the false gods and idols of the neighboring nations. Isaiah asks, “What likeness will you compare with Him?” He concludes in verse 25 with God Himself asking the same question: “To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?.” 

	* How is the true God different from the false gods?

		`__________________________________________________________________________`
		`__________________________________________________________________________`

#. **Finish reading the chapter, verses 27-31** 
	The prophet records the whining of Israel in verse 27 when they said, “God doesn't know about us” and “God doesn’t care about us.” But He did! 

	* According to these verses, how does God relate personally to you? Who is God to you?  Creator? Healer? Redeemer? Lord?

#. **How can we discover more of who God is?**

#. **Spend 5 minutes meditating on one of the characteristics of God**

.. topic:: *But I’m not a Christian...*

	*Read Psalms 23, This is David’s view of who God is and how God relates to him. David calls God, Lord or Ruler*
 
	*1. What other name does David have for God?*

	*2. God cares about David in many ways. What are some of the ways described here?*

	*3. How do you feel about the way that God is relating to David?*

 	*4. Christians believe that God cares about people and is involved in their lives. People also have a responsibility to respond to God. For example: in order for God to lead us, we have to be willing to follow.*

Live the Word 
-------------
 
1.  Ask someone you know what they think God is like. This could be a believer or pre-believer.
2.  Spend 10 minutes this week meditating on the attributes of God or praying through the names of God.
3.  Each day choose one attribute of God or name of God and journal how God has shown this part of His character in your life.   
4.  Come up with your own idea for how you can gain a deeper understanding of God’s character (perhaps through a Bible study or one of the recommended reading texts). 

.. topic:: *But I’m not a Christian...* 

	*1. Are you interested in trying to know God better?*

	*2. Talk to God this week.  Tell Him that you want to get to know him better.  Talk to him about what is happening in your life and ask for help.* 
	
	*3. Read Psalm 139 this week and consider other ways that God relates to people.*
