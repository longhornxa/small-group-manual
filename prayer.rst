Loving God: Prayer

**Prayer -- A dialogue with God**

As you spend time alone with God, prayer is key to developing a dialogue between you and God. Through prayer you can feel the Sprit, receive direction, gain revelation,  and impact the world around you.  This lesson will give you practical suggestions and ways to pray for yourself and others.


Theme Scriptures
---------------- 

**I Thessalonians 5:17**  *Pray without ceasing.*

**Matthew 7:7**  *Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.*

**James 5:13-16**  *Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.*
