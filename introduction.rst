Introduction
------------
 This small group manual was written to reflect and teach the core values of our Chi Alpha Community. As you reflect on the themes, we hope that you will not only increase in knowledge about God but also in obedience to Christ.  As you grow in maturity, our prayer is that you will gain an understanding and passion for God's plan to transform your life and through you, the nations of the world.

	Leader Notes
	^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Thank you for accepting God’s call to be a small group leader this semester.  We strongly believe at UT ChiAlpha that to grow big we need to think small.  This means that we believe healthy small groups are a key for both numerical and spiritual growth in our Chi Alpha group. 

	This leaders manual has been prepared for you to use with your small group.  

	Keys for a Healthy Small Group
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	1) A leader committed to loving God and the people in the group and to helping group members grow spiritually (that’s you!)
	2) 2-3 Core members who are also committed to the ministry of the small group and to growing spiritually together.  These people will be there every week, making the heart of the group. This could include a co-leader that you are mentoring until your group is ready for multiplication with the plan that they will then take leadership of half of the group at multiplication or continue leading the group after you graduate or are called elsewhere. 
	3) 1-3 New members whom you are continually inviting to the group and encouraging in Christ even if they are not as regular as your core members.  These are open groups, so the goal is to continually be inviting people to join over the course of a semester. Some of these could be pre-believers that your small group is reaching out to this semester.
	4)  If your ‘small’ group regularly begins to have  7-8 people (including the leader) start talking with your resource leader about multiplication


	Building your small group
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	1) Start praying about who God would want you to invest in this semester.
	2) We ask that the people you invite to your group be the same gender as you except in the case of married couples ministering together. 
	3) Invite students from your life group who are not connected to a small group to join you in the small group mission
	4) Invite new students you have just met at activities who show spiritual interest or who visit life group. 
	5) Talk with your resource leader to see if there are people in other life groups who for some reason (maybe scheduling or natural relationships) would fit better into your small group.


	Getting started
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	1) Once you have at least 2-3 other people willing to join you in your small group, you can set a time and place for meeting. It is usually good to make that time and place consistent every week. 

	2) We encourage you to meet weekly for at least one and a half hours.  

	3) The first time you get together can be mainly relational time if you prefer.  After this, we prefer that you spend relational time in addition to the weekly meeting that is focused on discipleship.  As relationships develop we hope that group members will enjoy meeting outside of the group time for fun together. 

	4) We encourage you to do one lesson in the Small group leaders manual each week.  These themes are ones that we think emphasize our core values and desired foundation for every person who graduates from Chi Alpha at UT.

	5) There are only 12 lessons each semester in the manual to try to make the curriculum flexible for some weeks when a lesson is focused on for 2 weeks or you plan another special  discipleship-focused activity such as a service project, prayer time or outreach. 

	Weekly Meetings
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Below is a suggested schedule for each weekly small group meeting.  Of course you can be flexible, but don’t regularly go way over on the time.  If people want to stay afterwards and fellowship longer, that is great, but make it clear that the main part of the meeting is over.  

	**Suggested Lesson Time Frame**
	
		* **How did it go? (5min)** *Review last week’s lesson and discuss applications people have done during the week*
		* **Who We Are? (15min)** *Get to know the background and spiritual journeys of group members*
		* **What About You? (10min)** *Have students discuss their personal experience related to the lesson topic and to get them thinking about the topic*
		* **In the Word (40min)** *Learn from God’s Word and begin to practice what it says*
		* **Live the Word (10min)** *Discuss how you can apply the lesson this week*
		* **Prayer (15min)** *Pray for each other’s needs and praise God for testimonies*

	**Tips for using the weekly meetings and small group manual to disciple the people in your group**

	1) Start on time and end on time 
	2) Try to complete one chapter per week.  This does not mean you have to ask every question in the chapter.  You can adapt the lesson theme or give your own applicable questions
	3) Add personal examples and give the students opportunities to give examples from their own experience.
	4) Make the group as interactive as possible while still communicating the core truths. 
	5) Have each group member choose an application from the ‘Live the Word’ section each week.  These are designed to be suggestions and not exhaustive.  Students should also have the opportunity to create their own application idea and follow through with it instead of choosing from the suggested ones.  
	6) Follow up on how the application went during the ‘How did it go” section of the next week’s lesson. 
	7) Be willing to get together one on one with group members as needed (for example to explain more about the baptism in the Holy Spirit or water baptism to someone or to explain the structure of the Bible in more detail or watch the Hope video together with someone who has never read the Bible.). 

	Need Help?
	^^^^^^^^^^

	Remember  your resource leaders and life group leaders are there for you to ask anything and to help you with any resources you need.  Please ask them if you come upon any situation where you feel out of your depth. 


	Lesson Components
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Below is a short description of each of the parts of of the weekly meeting described in this manual.  Please read through this so you can understand the 'spirit' of each section and use them to benefit your group. 

	**Theme Scriptures**
	
	These are scriptures that focus on the theme of the lesson.  You can use these as memory verses, meditation verses or just as references when teaching the lesson.  Some of them are included in the ‘In the Word’ section as teaching points.  

	**How did it go?**

	The purpose of this time is to follow up with application ideas from last week and to see if people are implementing the themes of the lesson into their lives during the week.   There are suggested questions in each lesson but you can also follow up with your own questions on things you were praying about last week or modify the questions to ask students who suggested a specific project for applying the lesson theme about whether they did it and their experience. 

	**Who We Are**

	This is the section that focuses on History sharing and getting to know each other.  Each member should share their spiritual journey with the group. After each member has had an opportunity for this, the time can be used for relational/get to know you time in the group.  You as a leader can decide if you want to ask a particular question for all members to answer, just informally hear about their weeks or major things going on in their lives or use this time to share praise reports and prayer requests once the group is comfortable with each other. See the history sharing section at the end of this chapter for more information. 

	**But I'm not a Christian....**
	
	These notes are put in sections to suggest modified questions, applications or in some cases lesson teaching for pre-believers.  You can use these instead of the questions given in the lesson if you have a primarily non-Christian group, or you can use some of them or mix them into the regular lesson to make it more applicable to pre-believing individuals if you have only one or two in your group.  
	These suggestions for discipling non-Christians are placed under the section to which they would apply.  
	In some cases an alternate 'In the Word' is provided for non-Christians that is focused on pre-discipleship instead of discipleship. 

	**What about you?**

	This section is designed to get the group discussing and thinking about the topic related to their own experience.  

	Hopefully it will give you an idea as the leader of what level of maturity your group members have reached in relation to the topic of the lesson.  This will help you to know during the 'In the Word' teaching section what level of detail and explanation you may have to provide for certain individuals who have little or no experience with the topic.   Please encourage everyone as they share their experience, loving them where they are instead of making them feel that they don't belong because they are not familiar with the topic. The small group  should  be a safe place where all members can share their struggles in relation to the areas of spiritual growth and where people can work together to grow.

	 If you have an unbeliever in your group, please ask them modified questions so that they can share their experience as well.  

	**In the Word**

	This is the main teaching component of the lesson.  There is an outline in your manual for scripture reading, discussion and teaching points related to the topic.  Try to make this time as interactive as possible.  You may need to omit questions or scriptures for time's sake or add your own points to clarify further for group members.  Please add your own examples and invite your group members to give examples from their experience that relate to the topic.  If you are having trouble finishing on time or going off on rabbit trails not directly related to the lesson, talk to your resource leader for tips on how to effectively communicate the lessons in 30-45 minutes.  


	**Live the Word**

	This section contains suggestions for applying the teaching practically during the week.  Encourage your group members to choose one (or two max) of these ideas to participate in during the week.  Let them know that you will ask them how it went at the beginning of the next small group meeting.  You and your group members could also suggest your own application ideas.  You should also choose one to apply during the week in your own life, because it will help you grow and will be an example to your members.  

	**Prayer**

	Minimally we would like you to spend some time praying for each other, and for UT Chi Alpha leadership and initiatives (life groups, outreaches etc....)  How you do this is up to you. You could have a different specific prayer focus each week or just be very informal. Chapter 7 Loving God through Worship contains resources that you can use in your group if you would like to include a worship time together. 

	History Sharing
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
	**Purpose of History Sharing**
	
		The goal of history sharing is to build intimacy and a basic familiarity with the spiritual journeys of each person in the group that will help you as a leader to get a sense for where they are spiritually. 

	**History Sharing Semester Schedule**

		Week 1 or 2:  The leader should set the example by being the one to start the history sharing in the first couple of weeks.  

		Weeks 2-4 (or however many people you have in the group).   Each week one group member should share their story for about 15 minutes.  

		Weeks 5-12  There is a suggested History Sharing question in each lesson that will help you to get to know each other in the group better.  Or you can make your own questions (or have group members take turns asking the question each week.)  Divide the 15 minutes by the number of people in your group and ask people to stick to the time limit when sharing their answer. You can also use the time for sharing updates on how specific things are going in each others’ lives once group members are comfortable sharing with each other without prompts. However, you still may need to set a time limit especially if one person tends to dominate the sharing time.  

	**Suggested Components of History Sharing**
	
		* Mention where you grew up and the spiritual atmosphere in your childhood home. 
		* Mention at what point you accepted Christ, were water baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit (if applicable)
		* Mention any important turning points in your life  (good or bad)
		* Mention any moments when you felt God calling you or speaking to you
		* Mention where you think you are in your spiritual journey now.  

	**Suggested Outline for History Sharing**

		* 5 min -- Spiritual background growing up and acceptance of Christ/going to church as a child
		* 5 min -- Important turning points or special moments in your spiritual journey
		* 5 min -- Where you are now spiritually and where you would like to be.
