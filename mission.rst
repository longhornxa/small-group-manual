**Mark 3:14**  *He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach.*
 
 
In the Word
-----------

Review the theme Scriptures at the beginning of the lesson.

1. We should remember that the Jesus’ first priority is that we be with him. 
	* Why do you that Jesus wanted his disciples to be with him in relation to preaching the gospel?
	* Based on this where do you think you need to start? In being with Jesus? In preaching?
 
	..topic:: Note  
		We don’t stop sharing the gospel just because we’ve missed a quiet time. However, it should always be our top priority to live from the overflow of God and not in our own strength. 

2. The second priority Jesus gave was that we should preach the gospel.
	* What does preaching the gospel mean to you?

3. Why do you think Jesus gave these two priorities?

4. Mathew 28:16-20 is called the Great Comission (CO-mission)

	**Matthew 28:16-20**
		16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18 Then Jesus came to them and said,“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20  and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

	* what is the mission?
	* What or why the CO?

	Some commenters say that this phrase “Therefore go” is translated from greek “as you go” meaning as you are doing your daily life make disciples.

	* Is making disciples part of your daily life? 

	We can show others how we love them through making disciples.

	When we live this way it is called living a missional life.

	* Discuss the differences between missions and missional. 

	“This is what it means to be missional. We experience the transforming truth of Christ and bring it to everything we do. Sometimes this means we work to share the specific truth of Christ’s grace. This is the traditional approach to missions. But often we share the common truth of grace, helping others to understand how their work contributes to the common good.

	“Witness is not just a little activity we do now and again. Witness is who we are,” said Guder. “The world will encounter God’s love in Christ… because Christians are equipped by God’s Spirit using Scripture to demonstrate the truth, the relevance, the healing power of the gospel.”  http://www.thehighcalling.org

	*Be intentional*

		* in your friendship sharing the gospel in your daily life through meeting people and becoming their friends. 
		
		* in the people that you meet - look for opportunities to help those you meet, pray for them, or share with them scriptural truth


	*Models for sharing the gospel* 
		* Romans road
		* Bridge diagram
		* The four spiritual laws

	*What to share*

		* What Jesus has done for you (your testimony in 3 min. or less)
		* Who Jesus is.
		* What He has done.
		* Why He did it ? 
		* How do we know Jesus did what he did.
		* How do we respond?
