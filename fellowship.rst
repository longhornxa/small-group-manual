Loving Others through Fellowship
================================

Introduction
------------

**Fellowship**

Fellowship is much more than just getting together, talking and eating.  These things are perhaps some of the outward expressions of fellowship. True fellowship is how we live out Jesus command to "Love one another as I have loved you" (John 13:34) Our attitude towards other Christians and how we treat each other can also reflect our love for God. What our fellowship shows about our relationships is also usually what attracts or repels others about our community.

Theme Scriptures
----------------

**John 13:34-35**
	*“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”*

**1 John 4:19-21**
	*"We love because he first loved us. Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister."*

**Hebrews 10:24-25**
	*"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching."*
