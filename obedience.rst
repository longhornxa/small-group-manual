In the Word
-----------
 
 1. We should obey God because we love Him and desire to please Him. **
Review the theme Scriptures at the beginning of the lesson.
**  	Why do you think that God would base our love for Him on our obedience?
·  `__________________________________________________________________________`
	Rhetorical Question: Based on this fact, do you feel like your heart is bent towards loving God? 
 
2. 2 Timothy 2:20-21 we should obey God (2 reasons)
`__________________________________________________________________________`

.. only:: leader    Paul says we are like the different kinds of dishes and pots in a large house: "Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work." (2 Tim. 2:20-21)
 
Paul wants us to ask ourselves, which kind of vessel do I want to be in God's kingdom? If, as a Christian, I fill my mind and heart with "dishonorable" things before God, I can expect to be like a vessel for "dishonorable use" (like the scrub bucket or the garbage can or the dish we put the dog food in).
 
·    **  What are things we can fill our life with that would be dishonorable to God?
·**  *What do we find appealing to us about ______ that it would keep us from honoring God by our actions?*
 
God may still use me for something in his kingdom, but there won't be much blessing in it. But, if I turn away from things that dishonor God, if I keep from my eyes and my mind from "what is dishonorable," then I will be to God like a dish made of gold or silver, "a vessel for honorable use ... ready for every good work." If we want God to use us in significant ways, we have to walk in obedience to him. 
 
·**      What are ways that we can dedicate ourselves to God?
·**      *What are ways that you could imagine that God using you in a greater way because of dedicating your life more to God?*

 
3. 1 Peter 2:12`__________________________________________________________________________`


.. only:: leader  We should obey God because we desire to see unbelievers come to Christ through observing our lives.
 
Peter tells believers that their good conduct will be their defense against slander and will often lead to the conversion of those who first speak against them. ·   
**   How can our actions be a witness to unbelievers?
·      Rhetorical Question, Does the way that you treat others push them closer or further from God?
·    **  What are ways that you can live that would help others to draw closer to God?
**

 2. What are things you can do to surrender those areas of disobedience to God and dedicate yourself to Him more fully?  
3. Have you followed the Lord in obedience in water baptism?

John 14:21
 Discussion Questions:
 
*As you are learning about God, do you feel like He loves you and desires good for your life?*  *
Think about a follower of Jesus that you know. Does seeing other believers lives draw you closer or farther away from desiring to know God?* *Are they keeping God’s commands?*  *
Why does God put so much emphasis on following his commands?
*  *Do you have a desire to please God in your own life?* *
Do you think that there are any benefits for living a life like Jesus?
* *Even if you haven’t fully given your life to follow Jesus, what are ways that you could dedicate yourself more to knowing Him and growing closer to Him?*
